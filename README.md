Model Information:
Model Type: Linear Regression
Model Architecture: The linear regression model assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. It tries to fit a straight line to the data.
Algorithm Used: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method is commonly used for estimating the parameters of the linear regression model.
Features: One feature (X) is used in this example, but it can be extended to multiple features.
Target Variable: Continuous variable (y)

Dataset Information:
Dataset Used: Synthetic dataset generated using make_regression function from scikit-learn.
Features: One feature (X) generated with random noise.
Target Variable: Continuous target variable (y) generated based on the input features.

Evaluation Metrics:
Evaluation Metric Used: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Purpose: MSE measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values. Lower MSE indicates better model performance.

Initial Accuracy:
Initial Accuracy Metric: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Initial Accuracy Value: 10%

Current Accuracy:
