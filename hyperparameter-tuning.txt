# Hyperparameter Tuning Test

# Since this model does not have any hyperparameters, we will focus on one: regularization strength
# Regularization helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.
# In scikit-learn's LinearRegression, we can choose between two types of regularization:
# Ridge regression (Ridge) and Lasso regression (Lasso).
# Both Ridge and Lasso have a hyperparameter called alpha, which controls the strength of regularization.
# We define a list of alpha values to try for regularization.
# We create a dictionary param_grid with the hyperparameters we want to tune.
# We use GridSearchCV to perform grid search cross-validation over the specified hyperparameters (alpha values).
# After fitting the grid search object to our data, we retrieve the best hyperparameters.
# Finally, we create a new Ridge regression model with the best alpha value and evaluate its performance.
# This process helps us find the optimal regularization strength for our linear regression model, potentially improving its accuracy.

# Accuracy decreased to 8%.
