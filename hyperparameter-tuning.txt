# Hyperparameter Tuning Test

# Since this model does not have any hyperparameters, we will focus on one: regularization strength
# Regularization helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.
# In scikit-learn's LinearRegression, we can choose between two types of regularization:
# Ridge regression (Ridge) and Lasso regression (Lasso).
# Both Ridge and Lasso have a hyperparameter called alpha, which controls the strength of regularization.
